## Project Description

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based handwriting recognition system, developed using TensorFlow.
he project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing specific tasks.

## File Structure

- `CNN_EMNIST/`: Contains the main code and data for the project
- `GUI.py`: Main program file
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment configuration file

## Installation Steps

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:


2. **Create and activate the Conda environment**:


3. **Modify storage paths**:
    Open the `GUI.py` file and modify the storage paths to match your local machine's storage paths. 

4. **Run the program**:
    ```bash
    python GUI.py
    ```

## Notes

- Ensure that the dependencies in the `environment.yml` file are correctly installed.
